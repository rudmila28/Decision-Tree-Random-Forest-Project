## Building a Model to classify and predict Borrowers repayment behavior using Decision Tree and Random Forest

**Background of the Project:**
This project is based on Lendingclub.com. Lending Club is an online platform that connects borrowers with investors. An investor always wants to invest in a person who shows a profile of having high probability of repayment. My task was to build a model that will predict whether or not the borrower makes the full repayment. 

**Work Process:**
I have collected the lending data of 9578 borrowers from 2007-2010. After that, I have imported necessary python libraries for this project. Using those libraries, I have performed an exploratory data analysis on the data through various visual representations. Then I have split the data into train and test sets to build Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification Model. I have predicted and evaluated both the models to determine their accuracy.  

**Result:**
By analyzing data, evaluating the model, I have generated classification report and confusion matrix to take my final decision on the performance of the model.
